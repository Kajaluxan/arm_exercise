## Hand Gesture Tracker
This project is a Hand Gesture Tracker built using OpenCV and MediaPipe in Python. It tracks hand movements, calculates angles between key landmarks, and counts finger-closing gestures. The system also provides real-time visual feedback and encouragement messages.

## Features
- **Real-Time Hand Tracking**: Detects and tracks hands using the MediaPipe library.
- **Angle Calculation**: Measures the angle between three key hand landmarks.
- **Finger Movement Counting**: Counts the number of times a hand transitions from an open to a closed state.
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays real-time angles, hand states, and instructions to guide finger movements.
- **Custom Suggestions**: Encourages users to open or close fingers based on hand position.
